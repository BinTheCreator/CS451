1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The project has 3 problems which are mainly adding the support for the multiple line comments and Operators and Reserved words, and lastly is adding support
   for Long and Double literals. For all of the problems, we first add the appropriate tokens into tokensInfo, only then we can add the support in the Scanner which
   will then scan the tokens that we added. Since we have added some cases and Operators, we continue to edit the Scanner to complete the project.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It was a little confusing at first, because of scanning the tokens for multiple line comments which also scan the condition for ending the comments,
   thus I run into some trouble there. but overall it was very enjoyable and interesting.
